# Team Pulse

Desktop menu-tray app that enables periodic surveys to be published and completed by clients. For example, an organization may seek ongoing, regular feedback from employees in the form of questions repeated on a weekly basis.

App is asymmetric, in that normal users see a survey and personalized profile, whereas organization administrators can (1) see aggregate survey data and responses from individual employees, (2) edit survey content and control the interval in which they are published, and (3) handle user account creation / deletion.
